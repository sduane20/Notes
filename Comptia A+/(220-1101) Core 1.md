## Troubleshooting Methodology (OBJ 5.1)
    - Identify the problem
        - Talk to the user, ask qualifying questions
    - Establish a theory of probable cause
        - Question anything that is easy and obvious to check
    - Test the theory to determine the cause
        - If the theory is not confirmed, re-stablish a new theory
    - Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution
    - Verify full system functionality
    - Document the findings, actions and outcome
